# samsungtv-media-helper ðŸ“º
 Node App that prepares a video or a series of videos to be viewable (and subtitled) in a Samsung TV through DLNA

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
 - Node.JS environment
 - ffmpeg installation in your path. In most Linux distros it should be available in the default package manager. In Windows systems it'd include downloading a [pre-compiled zip folder](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows), extracting it and adding the /bin folder into the [system path](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)

#### Optional
If you want to use the file selector you need to use one of the following OS families:
 - Windows
 - Linux
 - Mac OS

Else you will be required to provide the file via command line

### Installing

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/LuisMayo/samsungtv-media-helper
```

Install dependencies
``` bash
npm i
```

### Running
You can either provide an input file to be processed
``` bash
npm start ./breakdance.srt
```

Or you can launch it without arguments to be greeted by a file picker (only in Windows, Linux and Mac OS)
``` bash
npm start
```
